This project is not hosted but can be accessed by loading the attached html files into a browser. The cells will not be interactive like they would be in a Notebook.

## Requirements / Purpose

The project was completed as a part of the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) [Data Analytics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?promo=year_end&coupon=SPRING50&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=19167921312_c_individuals&utm_campaign=19167921312_c_individuals&utm_term=143524475759&utm_term=143524475759&utm_keyword=udacity).

Students were given a dataset containing information on aroung 200,000 trips on a bike sharing platform in San Francisco. Using Jupyter Notebooks and python visualization libraries, the data needed to be programmatically explored, wrangled, analyzed, and visualized.

Students then created an explanatory document using gleaned insights backed up by plotted data.

This project was made in:

- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org]) with Python 3 kernel
- NumPy
- Pandas
- MatPlotLib
- Seaborn
