## Requirements / Purpose

The project was completed as a part of the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) [Data Analytics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?promo=year_end&coupon=SPRING50&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=19167921312_c_individuals&utm_campaign=19167921312_c_individuals&utm_term=143524475759&utm_term=143524475759&utm_keyword=udacity). We were given a

Students were given three excel files containing data from Kaggle - one each for airlines, airports and individual flight data. Using Tableau, the data needed to be wrangled and compiled into a single joined dataset which could then be used to generate visualizations and a dashboard.

Using the created dashboard, students were then tasked with answering questions about which airlines or airports with the worst delays, what could be the root causes of those delays, and back up those arguments with filtered visualizations.

This project was made in

- Jupyter Notebooks with Python 3 kernel
- NumPy
- Pandas
- MatPlotLib
- Seaborn

## Features

- Users are able to select between full datasets or a filtered view of airports with more than 120 departures is a selected range.
- Interactive map that changes dynamically based on month range chosen.
- Dashboard compiling the data and map onto a single page
